# the last two lines are just to test it works. Leaving the ca-certificates
# package in is intentional, since nvidia uses https sources and without that,
# apt will complain about "Certificate verification failed: The certificate is
# NOT trusted. The certificate issuer is unknown.  Could not handshake: Error
# in the certificate verification. [IP: 23.221.236.160 443]"
# You will probably want to update ca-certificates in each apt stanza in each
# derived image since certificates can be revoked periodically and that package
# should always be up to date.
